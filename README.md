[![Join telegram channel](https://badges.aleen42.com/src/telegram.svg)](https://t.me/dcompass_channel)  
Your DNS supercharged! A high-performance DNS server with freestyle routing scheme support, DoT/DoH functionalities built-in.  
[中文版](README-CN.md)

# Why?

`dcompass` enables you to write your own logic of how your DNS server should behave, as simple as possible. It is "programmable".

# Features

- Fast (~2500 qps in wild where upstream perf is about the same)
- Fearless hot switch between network environments
- Customized routing rules that are easy to compose and maintain
- DoH/DoT/UDP supports
- "Always-on" cache mechanism to ensure DNS quality under severe network environments.
- Option to send no SNI indication to better counter censorship
- Option to disable AAAA query for those having network with incomplete IPv6 supports
- Written in pure Rust

# Notice

**[2021-07-26] Performance improvement and change on timeout syntax**  
We refactored most part of the code to improve the memory usage and response performance by up to 50%. Due to internal code changes, timeout configuration in DoT and DoH upstreams will not take affect anymore.

**[2021-03-22] New syntax on writing rule blocks and upstream definitions.**  
Breaking changes happened as new routing scheme has been adopted, see configuration section below to adapt.

# Usages

```
dcompass -c path/to/config.json # Or YAML
```

Or you can simply run `dcompass` from the folder where your configuration file named `config.yml` resides.  
You can also validate your configuration

```
dcompass -c path/to/config.json -v
```

# Packages

You can download binaries at [release page](https://github.com/LEXUGE/dcompass/releases).

1. GitHub Action build is set up for targets `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, `armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf`, `armv5te-unknown-linux-musleabi`, `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` and more. Typically, arm users should use binaries corresponding to their architecture. In particular, Raspberry Pi users can try all three (`armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf`, `armv5te-unknown-linux-musleabi`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`). Each of the targets has two different versions. `full` version includes the full maxmind GeoIP2 database, while the normal version includes [GeoIP2-CN](https://github.com/Hackl0us/GeoIP2-CN/) database only.
2. NixOS package is available at this repo as a flake. Also, for NixOS users, a NixOS modules is provided with systemd services and easy-to-setup interfaces in the same repository where package is provided.

cache is available at [cachix](https://dcompass.cachix.org), with public key `dcompass.cachix.org-1:uajJEJ1U9uy/y260jBIGgDwlyLqfL1sD5yaV/uWVlbk=` (`outputs.publicKey`).

# Quickstart

See [example.yaml](configs/example.yaml)

# Configuration

Configuration file contains different fields:

- `verbosity`: Log level filter. Possible values are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `off`.
- `address`: The address to bind on.
- `table`: A routing table composed of `rule` blocks. The table cannot be empty and should contains a single rule named with `start`. Each rule contains `tag`, `if`, `then`, and `else`. Latter two of which are of the form `(action1, action 2, ... , next)` (you can omit the action and write ONLY `(next)`), which means take the actions first and goto the next rule with the tag specified.
- `upstreams`: A set of upstreams. `timeout` is the time in seconds to timeout, which takes no effect on method `Hybrid` (default to 5). `tag` is the name of the upstream. `methods` is the method for each upstream.

Different actions:

- `blackhole`: Set response with a SOA message to curb further query. It is often used accompanied with `qtype` matcher to disable certain types of queries.
- `query(tag, cache policy)`: Send query via upstream with specified tag. Configure cache policy with one of the three levels: `disabled`, `standard`, `persistent`. See also [example](configs/query_cache_policy.yaml).

Different matchers: (More matchers to come)

- `any`: Matches anything.
- `domain(list of file paths or query name)`: Matches domain in specified domain lists. Supports gzip, lzma, and bzip2.
- `qtype(list of record types)`: Matches record type specified.
- `geoip(codes: list of country codes, path: optional path to the mmdb database file)`: If there is one or more `A` or `AAAA` records at the current state and the first of which has got a country code in the list specified, then it matches, otherwise it always doesn't match.
- `ipcidr(list of files that contain CIDR entries)`: Same as `geoip`, but it instead matches on CIDR. Supports gzip, lzma, and bzip2.

Different querying methods:

- `https`: DNS over HTTPS querying methods. `no_sni` means don't send SNI (useful to counter censorship). `name` is the TLS certification name of the remote server. `addr` is the remote server address.
- `tls`: DNS over TLS querying methods. `no_sni` means don't send SNI (useful to counter censorship). `name` is the TLS certification name of the remote server. `addr` is the remote server address.
- `udp`: Typical UDP querying method. `addr` is the remote server address.
- `hybrid`: Race multiple upstreams together. the value of which is a set of tags of upstreams. Note, you can include another `hybrid` inside the set as long as they don't form chain dependencies, which is prohibited and would be detected by `dcompass` in advance.
- `zone`: use local DNS zone file to provide customized responses. See also [zone config example](configs/success_zone.yaml)

See [example.yaml](configs/example.yaml) for a pre-configured out-of-box anti-pollution configuration (Only works with `full` or `cn` version, to use with `min`, please provide your own database).

Table example of using GeoIP to mitigate pollution

```yaml
table:
  start:
    if: any
    then:
      - query: domestic
      - check_secure
  check_secure:
    if:
      geoip:
        codes:
          - CN
    else:
      - query: secure
      - end
```

# Behind the scene details

- if one incoming DNS message contains more than one DNS query (which is impossible in wild), matchers only care about the first one.
- If a cache record is expired, we return back the expired cache and start a background query to update the cache, if which failed, the expired cache would be still returned back and background query would start again for next query on the same domain. The cache only gets purged if the internal LRU cache system purges it. This ensures cache is always available while dcompass complies TTL.

# Benchmark

Mocked benchmark:

```

                        Performance has improved.

```

Following benchmarks are not mocked, but they are rather based on multiple perfs in wild. Not meant to be accurate for statical purposes.

- On `i7-10710U`, dnsperf gets out `~760 qps` with `0.12s avg latency` and `0.27% ServFail` rate for a test of `15004` queries.
- As a reference SmartDNS gets `~640 qps` for the same test on the same hardware.

# TODO-list

- [ ] Support multiple inbound servers with different types like `DoH`, `DoT`, `TCP`, and `UDP`.
- [x] IP-CIDR matcher for both source address and response address
- [x] GeoIP matcher for source address
- [x] Custom response action
